# Runtime Production Composition Evidence

## Evidence Status

This ledger qualifies only the execution-wiring slice defined by `prd.md`.

| Dimension | Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PRD implementation | implementation-complete | process-local composition, ToolExecutor injection, selected Research parser adapter, fail-closed admission, caller inventory, and local gates are implemented |
| Docker isolation | environment-blocked | the authoring host has no available Docker daemon; no live parser process receipt is claimed |
| Child/event/recovery/MCP follow-ups | out-of-scope handoff | these are not completion requirements for this change and are not represented as execution-composition ports |
| Production release | not claimed | local contract and smoke evidence does not constitute a target-deployment release signature |

An evidence row is honest only when it records the exact commit, command, environment, result class, and relevant receipt/reference. Result classes are `contract-pass`, `integration-pass`, `blocked`, `skip`, and `qualification-complete`.

`RuntimeCompositionManifest` is a process-local versioned value object. It fingerprints execution config/policy/provider identity; it is not a distributed manifest service and does not contain child, durable-event, projection, operator, approval, or business side-effect ports.

## Scope Ownership and Handoff

| Boundary | Owner / follow-up | Evidence in this change |
| --- | --- | --- |
| execution registry, profiles, provider admission, ToolExecutor factory | `harness-runtime-production-composition` | implemented and locally qualified |
| selected Research Marker/MinerU parser | this change | controlled adapter implemented; Docker live execution blocked by environment |
| PDF compiler / Nougat | future parser/compiler vertical slice | no host-process fallback; caller inventory status remains `blocked` |
| outbound MCP/sidecar execution | future dedicated change | no production profile enabled; unsupported network/credential capabilities fail closed |
| child dispatch, lease, heartbeat, restart | `harness-child-supervisor-integration` | existing contracts reused; no completion claim |
| durable event, projection cursor, reconnect | `durable-event-runtime`, `runtime-event-operator-wiring` | existing owners unchanged; no execution-composition port binding |
| side-effect intent/outbox/reconciliation | `runtime-recovery-qualification` | execution receipt is not a business side-effect receipt |
| approval, artifact publication, memory write, routing, quality verdict | existing Harness/application owners | authority unchanged and covered by architecture/smoke regression |

## Capability and Profile Matrix

| Capability/profile | Declared behavior | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `runtime-trusted-in-process` | explicit deterministic pure functions only | contract-pass |
| `sandboxed_process` | framework mode exists; no production profile/provider enabled by this slice | admission-gated |
| `research-parser-marker` | `external_process`, provider `docker`, argv prefix `marker_single` | contract-pass / environment-blocked |
| `research-parser-mineru` | `external_process`, provider `docker`, argv prefix `mineru` | contract-pass / environment-blocked |
| filesystem roots and mount mapping | canonical read/write roots; symlink/traversal rejection | contract-pass |
| environment policy | protected variables rejected; parser variables explicitly allowlisted | contract-pass |
| network policy | selected parser requests network deny | contract-pass; no live isolation receipt |
| timeout/cancellation | timeout mapped; unconfirmed termination produces `INDETERMINATE` | contract-pass |
| Docker unavailable | stable `execution_provider_unavailable` denial; no host fallback | blocked as expected |
| Docker unsupported capabilities | network allowlist, secret handle, CPU/generic resource, child-executable allowlist denied with `newsroom.execution-capability-denials/v1` codes | contract-pass |

## Acceptance Criteria Matrix

| AC | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AC-01 composition injection | contract-pass | runner, Harness tool-result, batch, external subagent, API/worker/CLI, and Research composition tests in the focused command below |
| AC-02 fail-closed admission | contract-pass | execution-environment, ToolRuntime, API readiness, and diagnostics negative tests |
| AC-03 controlled Research parser | contract-pass | adapter tests plus compiler/cascade/default-composition tests prove exact identity propagation and forbid PyMuPDF/abstract fallback after an execution denial |
| AC-04 roots/env/network/timeout/termination receipt | contract-pass | execution-environment contract/adversarial tests plus parser adapter mapping tests |
| AC-05 Docker unavailable honesty | blocked as expected | default role `ready`; Research role `blocked`; default parser composition returns `execution_environment_unavailable`, with no provider execution, host fallback, or live-isolation claim |
| AC-06 explicit trusted profile | contract-pass | profile catalog and unsafe-downgrade admission tests |
| AC-07 control-plane authority unchanged | contract-pass | legacy control-plane bundle removed; architecture and smoke regressions pass |
| AC-08 reproducible gates | contract-pass | focused, compile, smoke, source validation, and strict OpenSpec rows below |

## Independent Review

The final execution-only scope, caller inventory, AC-01 through AC-08, authority handoffs, and parser failure path received an independent read-only review after the P0 repair. The review found no remaining P0 or P1 issue. In particular, it traced the exact `GraphExecutionIdentity` from `ResearchSinglePaperRuntime` through `ResearchDocumentCompilerAdapter` and `CascadeDocumentParser` to `ResearchParserExecutionAdapter`, and confirmed that an `ExecutionEnvironmentError` cannot reach PyMuPDF or abstract fallback.

## Remaining Environment Blocker

The only qualification blocker inside this PRD's selected production profile is the unavailable Docker daemon. A target environment with a reachable daemon must execute the selected parser and attach a real `ExecutionReceipt` before Docker isolation can be labeled `qualification-complete`. Until then:

- Research parser readiness/admission remains typed blocked.
- Local fakes and contract tests prove mapping and fail-closed behavior only.
- No host process fallback is permitted.
- Child/event/recovery/MCP follow-ups remain separate work, not hidden blockers for this execution-only change.

# Implementation Verification

## Status

The change is partially implemented. Checked tasks have focused code and test
evidence; unchecked tasks must not be treated as delivered merely because their
types or entrypoints exist. Generic orchestration remains disabled by default.
This record is not production rollout approval.

The PRD revision `e9a81f7d` expands the contracts. Proposal/design/specs/tasks
now follow G1-G5. The former 16/43 task count is historical, not acceptance of
durable submission/continuation, spawn reconciliation, multi-pool packing or
the expanded golden/replay matrix. No feature flag was enabled by this update.

## Verified Surface

- The Agent-owned orchestration contracts remove the reverse dependency from
  `framework/agent` into Harness while retaining strict request/result parsing.
- Parent delegation covers multi-child candidates, forbidden top-level and child
  control fields, fan-out limits, legacy mapping, bounded joined observations,
  redaction, failed/cancelled/indeterminate/halted outcomes, and turn exhaustion.
- `TaskPlanStageRunner` uses the supervised group/wave coordinator. Focused
  tests prove overlapping child execution, multi-wave join, explicit serial
  fallback, and fail-closed handling when the adapter is unavailable.
- Planning observation tests cover allowlisting, read-only authorization,
  durable receipt integrity, source-ref scope, and replay without live tools.
- Dynamic Research tests retain its fixed roles, aggregation contract,
  claim/quality/publication boundary, static default, and recorded replay path.
- G1 observation limits now use one Agent-owned data contract across AgentLoop,
  Harness and TaskPlanPolicy: 8 tasks, 2048 summary bytes, 16 diagnostics,
  16 refs and `max_observation_bytes=16384`. Old/unknown fields are rejected
  before dispatch; UTF-8 limits and policy checksum roundtrips are tested.
- Windows artifact containment compares equivalent DOS/extended DOS and
  UNC/extended UNC paths without removing their operational long-path prefix.
  Atomic I/O, directory traversal and locks use the corresponding namespace;
  escape/device/reparse defenses and POSIX root semantics are retained.

## Checks

The checks in this section precede the candidate-submission foundation below.
They remain historical evidence, not validation of subsequent edits.

- Combined TaskPlan, AgentLoop, dynamic Research, composition and architecture
  regression: 467 passed, 4 deprecation warnings.
- Agent, tool, and orchestration composition regression, including new parent
  boundary tests: 201 passed, 2 skipped.
- Strict OpenSpec validation: passed.
- PRD-aligned observation/AgentLoop/TaskPlan/composition regression: 155 passed.
- Artifact and transcript boundary regression: 159 passed, 3 skipped.
- Agent and tool regression on the final tree: 202 passed, 2 skipped.
- Earlier required full smoke: 2420 passed, 1 failed due to Windows namespace
  mismatch during concurrent filesystem transcript creation. This was not a
  passed commit gate.
- Repaired-tree required full `python -m scripts.dev smoke`: exit 0. Compile
  passed; Harness/Research/API/service/composition/architecture suite reported
  2475 passed, 23 deselected, 23 deprecation warnings in 842.69 seconds.
- The following offline AgentLoop smoke also succeeded with 3 LLM fixture calls,
  1 tool call and 0 network calls. Evidence manifest:
  `.newsroom/smoke/test-agent-loop-b3bc1b3de37b481c9a288f9035348490/manifest.json`.
- Source validation: `is_valid=true`, 0 errors, 0 warnings.
- Strict OpenSpec validation and `git diff --check`: passed on the updated tree.

These are checks of the current partial implementation, not proof of unchecked
G1-G5 scenarios. No production enablement, external-provider qualification or
rollback rehearsal is claimed. The current checklist has 10/46 completed items.

## Candidate Submission Foundation

This increment implements a scoped part of 1.4; 1.4 remains unchecked.

- `AgentOrchestrationRequest` v2 requires a trusted `parent_turn_id`. AgentLoop
  derives it from agent/activity/iteration identity, independently of the model's
  action correlation. Missing fields, old schema and unknown aliases are rejected.
- `CandidateSubmission` pins run/stage/parent-turn/action-correlation, the source
  action checksum, immutable candidate reference, original acceptance time and
  stable submission/plan identities. The record is committed in the canonical
  candidate-built event; an unreferenced artifact is not authoritative admission.
- Memory and durable stores atomically reuse equal admissions. Durable admission
  rechecks dedup using the same history snapshot used to allocate its sequence,
  then relies on event-stream CAS. Tests force a second writer to win between
  the first lookup and artifact completion; only one submission event survives.
- The stage binds the initial plan to the submitted candidate and original time.
  Restart after candidate admission but before plan acceptance reads that candidate
  without calling the candidate builder again.
- Accepted-plan success and failure outcomes are recorded with checksums and
  reused after reopening the runtime/store, without new events or worker calls.
  Reuse validates the complete history, causal admission, gated aggregate and
  terminal plan/projection identity. Conflicting payloads return
  `CANDIDATE_IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT` without old result refs or projection mutation.
- The canonical catalog now registers the existing group/wave event vocabulary
  with closed nested payload schemas. TaskPlan imports that vocabulary rather
  than maintaining a second list. Real durable lifecycle payloads, missing fields
  and forbidden nested control fields are tested.
- Expanded event regression exposed a reducer-audit classification defect:
  `inspect.getclosurevars` includes import/attribute names matching module globals.
  Dependency checks now examine actual global reads. Forbidden imports and
  captured capabilities remain rejected with the existing strict assertions.

Increment checks:

- Submission/store/replay/runtime/schema regression: 104 passed.
- Events, AgentLoop and orchestration composition regression: 538 passed.
- Strict OpenSpec validation: passed.
- Required full `python -m scripts.dev smoke`: exit 0. Compile passed; the
  Harness/Research/API/service/composition/architecture suite reported
  `2537 passed, 23 deselected, 23 warnings` in 904.54 seconds. The offline
  AgentLoop smoke produced 3 fixture LLM calls, 1 tool call and 0 network calls;
  source validation reported `is_valid=true`, 0 errors and 0 warnings.
- Parallel lifecycle/replay regression: 34 passed. This covers shared group/wave
  transition validation, typed terminal outcomes, terminal reservation checksum
  readback, failed-group event parity and rejection of corrupt durable transitions.

The store can distinguish multiple submission identities, but stage execution
still owns one plan chain per run/stage. A different turn or correlation is
therefore rejected as `task_plan_submission_scope_unavailable`, never aliased to
old results. Multiple submission execution scopes, concurrent active-execution
coalescing, pre-plan rejection outcome reuse, `PENDING` receipts and durable
same-parent-turn continuation are still acceptance work. No G1/G3/G5 gate or
production readiness is claimed by these focused checks.

## Remaining Acceptance Work

### Spawn Recovery Audit Increment

This increment advances 2.5; its full acceptance checkbox remains open. The
current checklist is 12/46, superseding the earlier historical counts above.

- Online spawn reconciliation records one correlated `RECOVERY_STATUS_READ`
  before each supervisor query and a `RECOVERY_RECONCILED` or `RECOVERY_HALTED`
  conclusion. Canonical schemas require group/wave/task/attempt/operation and
  recovery identity; run/stage/plan identity is carried by the TaskPlan envelope.
- A complete wave and all intents are validated before any live read or local
  admission mutation. Restart consumes verified replay group/wave snapshots;
  terminal groups cannot be reopened, and the existing dispatch lock serializes
  admission with recovery. Confirmed worker handles are retained, not respawned.
- Receipt caches are updated only after append succeeds. An interrupted audit
  conclusion can be retried from its recorded status read without another live
  call. Identical receipt delivery is reused; conflicting status, child or task
  identity is rejected before canonical append, including same-batch conflicts.
- Group admission also rolls back its in-memory session when the durable
  admission append fails, so a retry cannot be suppressed by a ghost group.
- Coordinator recovery now validates and reuses a terminal `TaskResultRecord`
  held by the controlled child adapter after a parent-side append interruption;
  mismatched result identity is rejected before the child is closed. The
  supervisor terminal event also persists a checksum-bound result envelope, so
  a fresh supervisor/coordinator can recover the typed task result without
  invoking a live worker; resolver-backed results must match the same checksum.
- When a verified parent result is already recovered, a confirmed terminal child
  receipt (including a child-side FAILED/CANCELLED state) no longer blocks the
  group join; the child is closed and the verified parent result remains the
  source of truth.
- The stage now invokes admission reconciliation before its normal scheduling
  loop. It rehydrates both admitted and already-dispatched nonterminal waves
  from canonical history. No new wave, budget charge or child is created by
  this path.
- The stage now invokes coordinator result recovery on every parallel loop,
  including when the parent result store is empty. A checksum-bound terminal
  child result can therefore be written back through the normal TaskPlan
  result transition after a parent-side crash; failure-attempt history is used
  for idempotent suppression so retry scheduling is not duplicated.
- Supervised child join now revalidates task id, task-instance id, attempt, and
  frozen plan identity before accepting a result, preventing a terminal child
  from injecting an outcome from another attempt or plan.
- Offline reduction verifies every audit against its admitted spawn operation,
  status-read identity and receipt. Audited confirmations are the only route
  for reopening an indeterminate group at this boundary. Unknown outcomes keep
  their outstanding reservations; they are not evidence of released capacity.
- Canonical-store/checkpoint tests exercise crashes before receipt commit,
  before dispatch commit and after dispatch commit, with one dispatch fact and
  zero live supervisor calls during replay. Additional tests cover partial or
  duplicate intent sets, audit write failures, conflicting/untrackable handles,
  terminal groups, receipt redelivery and corrupted recovery evidence.

Increment checks before final commit:

- Spawn recovery audit suite: 33 passed, including a fresh coordinator/process
  restart that re-reads child status and reuses durable receipts.
- Broader TaskPlan/AgentLoop/supervisor regression: 296 passed; focused spawn
  and receipt recovery regression: 61 passed.
- Final required repository smoke: passed (`2642 passed, 23 deselected`, plus
  smoke AgentLoop artifact and source validation).
- Strict OpenSpec validation: passed.

Remaining 2.5/2.13 work includes auditing the older wait/close recovery path,
durable supervisor restoration beyond terminal result envelopes, and
ledger/admission conflict recovery. This increment proves admission, dispatch,
and terminal child-result repair, not successful whole-stage completion after
every crash.
G1-G5, rollout, and production readiness remain unproven.

### Broader Acceptance

- Route generic children through the real controlled Agent runtime and persist
  ToolExecutor/ToolBatchExecutor receipts under their child attempt identity.
- Bind group/wave identity into task-result verification and durable child
  evidence, not only coordinator events.
- Complete bounded planning retries, failure accounting, and crash handling.
- Complete durable candidate dedup and RefAuthority, per-task spawn intent/receipt
  reconciliation, multi-pool capacity and versioned budget reservations, and
  terminal dependency blocking under the revised PRD.
- Replace synchronous-only parent dispatch with durable submission and
  idempotent same-turn continuation; complete deterministic summary spill and
  full legacy result/cancellation/recovery golden fixtures.
- Complete negative production composition checks for all required durable
  transcript, artifact, tool, profile and capability dependencies.
- Expand recovery/replay coverage to failed, cancelled, indeterminate,
  lease-expired and serial-fallback groups, with no live execution during replay.
- Capture rollout telemetry and replay evidence before enabling any default or
  presenting the dynamic Research entrypoint as production-ready.

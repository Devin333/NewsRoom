## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Harness accepts bounded multi-child delegation candidates

Harness SHALL provide a versioned orchestration contract that accepts a parent Agent `PlanCandidate` or `delegate_batch` candidate containing multiple logical child task proposals. Each proposal MUST contain a stable task identity, objective, input references, logical capability hint, declared output roles, and dependency references. Harness MUST validate the candidate against the pinned stage policy before creating any child attempt or DispatchGroup.

#### Scenario: Parent proposes independent child tasks

- **WHEN** a parent candidate contains two independent tasks whose capabilities, inputs, outputs, and dependencies satisfy the pinned policy
- **THEN** Harness MUST accept an immutable plan version and create one DispatchGroup identity for the plan's complete logical execution scope
- **AND** no child may start before the plan and group/wave admission events are durable

#### Scenario: Candidate attempts to select a worker or route

- **WHEN** a candidate contains a callable, concrete worker id, queue name, `next_step`, quality verdict, publication command, memory promotion, or halt instruction
- **THEN** Harness MUST reject the candidate with a typed validation reason
- **AND** it MUST not create a group, queue projection, or child attempt

#### Scenario: Candidate widens concurrency or authorization

- **WHEN** a candidate requests more parallelism, tools, memory namespaces, capabilities, or budget than the pinned policy allows
- **THEN** Harness MUST clamp only values explicitly defined as safe hints or reject the candidate when clamping would change its declared contract
- **AND** the candidate MUST never grant itself additional authority

### Requirement: Group and wave admission SHALL be bounded and durable

Harness SHALL create a durable `DispatchGroup` only after the complete plan scope, dependency closure, required roles, capability bindings, policy checksum, input-reference authority, and total budget envelope validate. A group MAY contain tasks that are not ready yet. Harness SHALL create each `DispatchWave` only after its selected tasks are ready and their side-effect, budget, and capacity checks pass. A group covers the complete logical join scope; a wave covers one physical dispatch bounded by current capacity. The effective parallelism MUST be the minimum of stage policy, capability capacity, child supervisor capacity, and available concurrency reservations. Group admission MUST pin but not consume the total budget envelope. Wave admission MUST atomically reserve each selected task's normalized budget and capacity exactly once using `RESERVED -> CONSUMED | RELEASED`; later waves MUST reuse the same group identity.

#### Scenario: Group and first wave are admitted within capacity

- **WHEN** three ready read-only tasks fit within `max_parallelism`, child capacity, and the remaining budget
- **THEN** Harness MUST persist one group admission and one wave admission with group id, wave id, plan version, task identities, join policy, reservations, and effective parallelism
- **AND** it MUST dispatch no task that is absent from the corresponding wave admission

#### Scenario: Eligible tasks require real concurrency

- **WHEN** at least two ready tasks are independent, concurrency-safe, reserved, and `effective_parallelism` is at least two without `serial_fallback`
- **THEN** Harness MUST start up to `effective_parallelism` child attempts concurrently
- **AND** an implementation that always invokes those tasks sequentially MUST NOT satisfy this requirement

#### Scenario: Ready set exceeds capacity

- **WHEN** five tasks are ready but the effective parallelism is two
- **THEN** Harness MUST dispatch at most two tasks in the current wave
- **AND** the remaining tasks MUST remain durable READY projections for a later wave in the same group without creating unbounded child attempts

#### Scenario: Side-effecting tasks lack a fence

- **WHEN** two ready tasks can write the same external resource and no policy-approved deterministic fence exists
- **THEN** Harness MUST reject concurrent admission for the conflicting tasks
- **AND** it MUST either schedule them serially under an explicit serial policy or return a typed conflict diagnostic

### Requirement: Child attempts SHALL reuse the controlled Agent runtime

Every admitted task MUST execute as an independent child attempt through the registered capability binding, `ChildAgentSupervisor`, and `SubAgentRuntime` or an equivalent Harness-owned worker adapter. The child envelope MUST contain only policy-approved input refs, tool allowlists, memory namespaces, context limits, and budget. A child tool call MUST be attributed to that child attempt and MUST pass the existing `ToolExecutor` authorization and receipt checks.

#### Scenario: Child uses an allowlisted tool

- **WHEN** a resolved child capability calls a tool listed in its `SubAgentSpec` and stage policy
- **THEN** the ToolRuntime MUST execute it under the child attempt identity and persist its receipt
- **AND** the tool observation MAY be used as child evidence but MUST NOT alter parent routing or policy

#### Scenario: Child requests a disallowed tool

- **WHEN** a child requests a tool outside the resolved allowlist or beyond the child budget
- **THEN** the tool call MUST be denied deterministically
- **AND** the child result MUST enter the existing rejected or failed gate path without widening permissions

#### Scenario: Child returns a control field

- **WHEN** a child result contains workflow routing, quality, publication, memory promotion, or arbitrary executable fields
- **THEN** the result gate MUST reject or strip those fields according to the result contract
- **AND** the fields MUST NOT influence group join or parent Agent continuation

### Requirement: Fan-in SHALL produce a deterministic parent result package

Harness SHALL wait for the policy-selected group join condition, verify every child result independently, and aggregate only accepted result references across all waves in the group. The aggregate MUST use stable plan order, enforce required roles and output conflict rules, include every task result checksum, and expose a versioned `ParallelDispatchResult` to the parent Agent as one security-projected observation.

#### Scenario: All required children succeed

- **WHEN** every required child reaches a verified success state and output roles are complete
- **THEN** Harness MUST persist a joined result package with stable task summaries, result refs/checksums, aggregate ref/checksum, budget usage, and gate evidence
- **AND** the parent Agent MUST receive one joined observation that it can use in its next candidate turn

#### Scenario: One required child fails

- **WHEN** the join policy is `wait_all` and a required child reaches terminal failure after bounded retry
- **THEN** Harness MUST withhold the aggregate and return a typed partial-failure result
- **AND** no incomplete output may be published as a successful parent observation

#### Scenario: Completion order differs from plan order

- **WHEN** child B finishes before child A even though A precedes B in the accepted plan
- **THEN** the joined task list and aggregate checksum MUST follow the stable plan order
- **AND** completion timing MUST not change the parent result or downstream decision checksum

#### Scenario: Parent observation is inspected

- **WHEN** an authorized caller reads a joined result package
- **THEN** it MUST expose group/wave/task identities, statuses, refs, checksums, diagnostics, and budget/recovery summaries
- **AND** it MUST redact hidden prompts, secrets, sibling private transcripts, and unauthorized payloads

### Requirement: Group failure handling SHALL be explicit and bounded

Harness SHALL apply the group's pinned `join_policy`, retry budget, replan budget, and cancellation policy. A retry MUST use a new attempt identity; a replan MUST create an immutable next plan version and a new `DispatchGroup`. `ADD_REPLACEMENT_TASK` MAY target only a terminal failed logical task; `SKIP_PENDING_TASK` and `UPDATE_PENDING_DEPENDENCY` MAY target only tasks not admitted to any wave. Running tasks, completed results, required roles, policy, gates, and outer Graph data MUST remain immutable.

#### Scenario: Retryable child failure is retried

- **WHEN** a child fails a retryable deterministic gate and its task has remaining attempts
- **THEN** Harness MUST persist the failed attempt and create at most one next attempt according to the retry budget
- **AND** it MUST not reuse the failed attempt identity or silently increase the budget

#### Scenario: Retry budget is exhausted

- **WHEN** a required task reaches `max_task_attempts` and the policy allows replan
- **THEN** Harness MAY create a versioned replacement-task patch against the current plan version
- **AND** it MUST preserve all verified sibling evidence, reuse a sibling result only when policy/schema/input identity allow it, and re-run role/aggregate validation

#### Scenario: Fail-fast cancellation is selected

- **WHEN** a non-retryable child fails under `fail_fast` join policy while siblings are pending or running
- **THEN** Harness MUST persist cancellation requests and terminal cancellation outcomes for affected siblings
- **AND** it MUST close the group and return a failed group without treating cancelled or partial outputs as success

#### Scenario: Replan budget is exhausted

- **WHEN** a group cannot satisfy required roles and its retry/replan budgets are exhausted
- **THEN** Harness MUST enter a typed controlled failure or halt state
- **AND** it MUST not ask the LLM to bypass the gate or create an unbounded task loop

### Requirement: Group and wave lifecycle SHALL be replayable and recoverable

Harness SHALL persist group admission, wave admission/dispatch, child lifecycle, join waiting, join completion, retry, replan, cancel, reclaim, and recovery transitions in the canonical event stream. Checkpoints MUST include group/wave identity, plan version/checksum, task projections, attempt receipts, budget reservations/releases, join policy, aggregate evidence, and stream sequence. Replay and crash recovery MUST use recorded evidence and MUST NOT call live LLMs, tools, workers, queues, or publication adapters.

#### Scenario: Crash occurs after admission

- **WHEN** the process crashes after a group admission event but before all wave projections are materialized
- **THEN** recovery MUST reload the accepted plan and group, recreate only missing bounded dispatch projections, and preserve task/attempt identities
- **AND** it MUST not generate a new candidate or duplicate the group

#### Scenario: Crash occurs after child receipt commit

- **WHEN** a child receipt and output artifact are durable but the matching task result transition is missing
- **THEN** reconciliation MUST verify the receipt and append only the missing result/join transition
- **AND** it MUST not invoke the child or tool again

#### Scenario: Lease expires with uncertain outcome

- **WHEN** a child has no verifiable terminal receipt after its lease expires
- **THEN** Harness MUST follow the pinned reclaim policy and record an indeterminate or controlled retry outcome
- **AND** it MUST not assume success or replay an unconfirmed external side effect

#### Scenario: Side-effect outcome is uncertain during recovery

- **WHEN** recovery cannot verify whether a non-idempotent child or tool side effect committed
- **THEN** Harness MUST fail closed or require deterministic reconciliation under the pinned policy
- **AND** at-least-once recovery MUST NOT be represented as cross-process exactly-once execution

#### Scenario: Completed group is replayed

- **WHEN** an operator replays a completed group from checkpoint and durable events
- **THEN** replay MUST reproduce the same task order, result checksums, aggregate checksum, and parent observation
- **AND** replay MUST perform no live child, tool, queue, or LLM call

### Requirement: Parallel orchestration SHALL expose bounded operations telemetry

The orchestration projection SHALL expose group id, wave ids, plan/task/attempt identities, effective and requested parallelism, admission/queue/wait/run/join durations, child statuses, join policy, budget reservation/release and usage, retry/replan counts, recovery outcome, and any `DEGRADED_SERIAL` reason. Telemetry MUST be security-projected and correlated to the parent run.

#### Scenario: Parallel group completes

- **WHEN** a group joins successfully
- **THEN** authorized inspection and metrics MUST expose the effective parallelism, child terminal counts, join duration, budget usage, and aggregate checksum
- **AND** all fields MUST point to the same parent run and plan version

#### Scenario: Serial fallback is used

- **WHEN** an explicitly configured serial adapter executes a group because parallel capacity is unavailable
- **THEN** the event and inspection projection MUST state `DEGRADED_SERIAL` and the stable reason
- **AND** the runtime MUST not present the execution as parallel success

### Requirement: Group and wave state transitions SHALL be explicit

Each `DispatchGroup` MUST use the states `PLANNED`, `ADMITTED`, `DISPATCHING`, `RUNNING`, `JOINING`, `REPLAN_PENDING`, `SUCCEEDED`, `FAILED`, `CANCELLED`, `INDETERMINATE`, `HALTED`, and `SUPERSEDED`. `SUCCEEDED`, `FAILED`, `CANCELLED`, `INDETERMINATE`, `HALTED`, and `SUPERSEDED` are terminal. Each `DispatchWave` MUST use `PLANNED`, `ADMITTED`, `DISPATCHING`, `RUNNING`, and `TERMINAL`. Every transition MUST define one owner, one canonical event name, one idempotency key, allowed successor states, terminality, and recovery action. `REPLAN_PENDING` is coordinator-internal and non-terminal; it MUST become `SUPERSEDED` only after the replacement plan/group is accepted, or `FAILED`/`HALTED` when replan cannot complete. It MUST NOT be exposed as a final parent outcome.

#### Scenario: Group spans multiple waves

- **WHEN** the ready set exceeds effective parallelism
- **THEN** every wave MUST reference the same group id and plan version
- **AND** the group MUST not join or aggregate until all required tasks across its waves satisfy the pinned join policy

#### Scenario: Fail-fast group closes

- **WHEN** a non-retryable failure occurs under `fail_fast`
- **THEN** the coordinator MUST record failure, close group admission, request sibling cancellation, and wait for cancel receipt or lease expiry
- **AND** late success receipts MUST be quarantined to the closed group and MUST NOT change its aggregate
